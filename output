From Cynthia

Love,
All the queries that this part of my team runs are ad-hoc, and ad-hoc queries are a significant portion of their job.
What other options are there, besides asking my team to work non-business hours to do their daily functions?
Thanks,
Cynthia
 
Hello Cynthia,

Apologies for the confusion. My recommendation was for this particular case and recommendation doesn’t apply to everything your team is doing. 

Having said above: As suggested earlier if we someone can schedule a call or we can take the lead here, and fill us with the right information i.e. What processes are being delayed, when and what time? And how long are these processes going to run (example: Some teams may want to establish some baselines and would need our assistance in expediting there processes)
