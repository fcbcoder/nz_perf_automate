Dropping a DB User with DB Objects

Dropping a DB user:

In the event the NZA_tls_user_maint.sh script fails to drop a user due to objects owned by the user. The DBA team will change the ownership of these objects to the FCBORPHAN user. Then the user will be dropped with the next execute of the script.

/nz/support/bin/nz_change_owner -from <USERTODEL> -to FCBORPHAN >> /export/home/nz/DBA_Scripts/logs/changeowner <USERTODEL>.sql

Example : /nz/support/bin/nz_change_owner -from AB4A -to FCBORPHAN >> /export/home/nz/DBA_Scripts/logs/changeownerAB4A.sql


nzsql -f /export/home/nz/DBA_Scripts/logs/ changeowner <USERTODEL>.sql -o /export/home/nz/DBA_Scripts/logs/ changeowner <USERTODEL>.out

Example: nzsql -f /export/home/nz/DBA_Scripts/logs/changeownerAB4A.sql -o /export/home/nz/DBA_Scripts/logs/changeownerAB4A.out
