Hello Cynthia,
Thank you for clarifying. I understand that ad-hoc queries are a core part of your team's daily work, and running them during non-business hours isn't a viable solution.
To help us identify the best approach for your team, we'd like to gather some additional context. Specifically, it would be helpful to understand:

Which specific processes or queries are experiencing delays
When these delays typically occur (time of day, day of week)
Expected runtime for these queries under normal conditions
Whether this is an ongoing issue or tied to particular peak periods

With this information, we can explore targeted solutions—such as adjusting resource allocation, temporarily increasing query priority for specific users, or identifying optimization opportunities—and determine how long any interim measures would need to remain in place.
Would you be available for a brief call to discuss, or would you prefer to share these details via email? Either way, we're committed to finding a solution that supports your team's day-to-day operations without disruption.
