In Netezza production we have a table, which is being loaded/refreshed with new data every 30 mins, this job is loading new data into the table and running generate statistics at the end of the load. In some instances, this generate statics step is running way too longer. We are trying to check if we can make any changes to make it efficient. 

Can you please look into the below table and run stats statement to see if we can approach this in a different way or any other suggestions to make it run quicker.

Table: DSLAND. RTP_INTRADAY_TRANSACTION

SET ENABLE_JIT_DISPERSION=FALSE;  GENERATE STATISTICS ON DSLAND.RTP_INTRADAY_TRANSACTION;
