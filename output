Hello Gary,

This is to bring to your attention; I was pulled into another page late night for an unrelated issue.  (Earlier I was pulled into DataStage issue posted in our Channel)

Bottom line:

What I am getting the feel is L1/L2 have been told by their respective teams to submit any SQL related issue to our queue (These L1/L2 folks don’t have any knowledge w.r.t the NZ servers, Read messages, etc)
