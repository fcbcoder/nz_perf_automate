Hi Gary,

I wanted to bring to your attention a recurring pattern that is causing unnecessary after-hours disruptions for our team.

It appears L1/L2 teams have been instructed by their respective L3 groups to route any SQL-related issue directly to our queue — without first performing basic triage on their end. The concern here is that L1/L2 do not have access to Netezza, nor do they have knowledge of our NZ servers, read messages, or environment details. As a result, they are unable to determine whether an issue is actually Netezza-related before engaging us.

A recent example illustrates this well. Late last night, I was paged for the below error:

  Job Invocation ID: DISPADS040D
  Job: bSPPR004_ODS_ODS_CIS_CUSTOMER_n_V1_Refresh_from_Landing
  Step: cSPPR004_CIS_ODS_3000_Load_SQL
  Error: SQL0575N – View or materialized query table "DSLAND.V_ODS_CUSTOMER_DAILY_CURRENT" cannot be used because it has been marked inoperative. (SQLSTATE=51024)
  DSN: LNDFCBPR | Schema: DSLAND

This is clearly a DB2/Landing Zone issue — not a Netezza issue — and could have been identified by L3 before our team was engaged. I was also pulled in earlier the same night for a DataStage issue posted in our channel, which was similarly unrelated to our scope.

My ask is that we establish a clear expectation: L1/L2 should first engage their respective L3 teams for proper diagnosis. Only once L3 has confirmed the issue is within our domain should a ticket be routed to our queue.

Happy to discuss further if helpful.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
