I can help you analyze this Netezza statistics generation issue and suggest optimizations. Let me break down the problem and provide solutions:
Current Situation Analysis
Your GENERATE STATISTICS is running on a table that refreshes every 30 minutes, and the statistics generation is becoming a bottleneck. The SET ENABLE_JIT_DISPERSION=FALSE suggests you're already trying to address performance issues.
Recommended Approaches
1. Use Express Statistics (Fastest Option)
Instead of full statistics, use express mode which samples data rather than scanning the entire table:
sqlSET ENABLE_JIT_DISPERSION=FALSE;
GENERATE EXPRESS STATISTICS ON DSLAND.RTP_INTRADAY_TRANSACTION;
Benefits: 5-10x faster, usually sufficient for query optimization, especially good for frequently updated tables.
2. Selective Column Statistics
Generate statistics only on columns used in JOINs, WHERE clauses, and GROUP BY:
sqlSET ENABLE_JIT_DISPERSION=FALSE;
GENERATE STATISTICS ON DSLAND.RTP_INTRADAY_TRANSACTION 
    (column1, column2, column3);  -- specify your key columns
3. Conditional Statistics Generation
Only run statistics when data volume changes significantly:
sql-- Check row count change before running stats
-- Run statistics only if change > threshold (e.g., 10%)
4. Optimize the Table Structure
Consider these changes:

Organize on key columns: Ensure the table is organized on columns most frequently used in queries
Zone maps: Verify zone maps are effective for your query patterns
Distribution key: Review if the distribution key is optimal for your workload

sql-- Check current organization
SELECT * FROM _V_TABLE_DIST_MAP 
WHERE TABLENAME = 'RTP_INTRADAY_TRANSACTION';
5. Alternative Loading Strategy
Incremental approach:

Load data into a staging table
Run statistics on staging table
Swap/rename tables (nearly instantaneous)

sql-- Load into staging
INSERT INTO RTP_INTRADAY_TRANSACTION_STG ...;
GENERATE EXPRESS STATISTICS ON RTP_INTRADAY_TRANSACTION_STG;

-- Swap tables
ALTER TABLE RTP_INTRADAY_TRANSACTION RENAME TO RTP_INTRADAY_TRANSACTION_OLD;
ALTER TABLE RTP_INTRADAY_TRANSACTION_STG RENAME TO RTP_INTRADAY_TRANSACTION;
Immediate Recommendations
Start with this:
sqlSET ENABLE_JIT_DISPERSION=FALSE;
GENERATE EXPRESS STATISTICS ON DSLAND.RTP_INTRADAY_TRANSACTION;
If you need more precision on specific columns:
sqlSET ENABLE_JIT_DISPERSION=FALSE;
GENERATE EXPRESS STATISTICS ON DSLAND.RTP_INTRADAY_TRANSACTION (key_col1, key_col2, join_col);
Additional Checks

Monitor statistics age: Check _V_TABLE_STAT_INFO to see when statistics were last updated
Query plan analysis: Verify if full statistics are actually improving query performance
Consider skipping statistics: For some 30-minute refresh cycles, stale statistics might be acceptable if queries perform adequately

Would you like me to help you identify which columns would benefit most from statistics, or analyze your specific query patterns to optimize further?
