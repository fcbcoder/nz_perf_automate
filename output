Hello [Senior Director's Name],
I wanted to provide you with an update following our meeting with Cynthia's team regarding the ad-hoc query performance challenges they've been experiencing in the production environment.
Meeting Summary:
We met with the team to better understand their workload and explore viable solutions that wouldn't disrupt their daily operations. After discussing their specific use cases, we recommended redirecting their ad-hoc development queries to the UAT environment instead of PROD, which experiences significantly higher load during business hours.
Recommended Solution:

Point SAS profiles to UAT for ad-hoc development work
Team members may need to coordinate with their respective application teams to obtain necessary UAT access

Key Details:

UAT maintains similar capacity to PROD in terms of resources
Given UAT's lower utilization during business hours, ad-hoc queries should experience notably better performance compared to PROD
This approach addresses the performance concerns while maintaining business continuity

Next Steps:
The team can reach out to the DBA team for assistance with this transition, and we're committed to supporting them throughout the process.
Please let me know if you need any additional information or have questions about this approach.
Best regards,
[Your Name]
